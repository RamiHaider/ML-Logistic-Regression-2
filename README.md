Which he created a Logistic Regression from scratch and using a 1000 datapoint train set, with 6 variables, he achieved a 91% accuracy score.
Using the same parameters as he, i.e., 100,000 epoch, and 0.0015 learning rate, using my own hand-coded logistic regression, we achieved
the exact same Cost Function, ~0.447, and the same accuracy.
